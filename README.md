- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @XiaoZhangZhangRice
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Plant and Soil Sciences
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning tools for statistical analyses and computation in the biological sciences. Currently creating R resources to calculate greenhouse gas fluxes from peak values from gas chromatography and running field experiments that investigate rice methane suppression. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: https://calendly.com/zhangzhenglin
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love to cook, hike, and have an artist in me. I do miss creating art as I dig myself deeper into the sciences.
